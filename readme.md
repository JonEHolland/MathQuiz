# MathQuiz

This is a very simple flash card game that I built for my daughter to help her get faster at basic math.

Built primarily in Javascript using Knockout.js, and a tiny bit of ASP.NET MVC to serve up the page.

The only reason for the service side component is that I plan to eventually add grade tracking.
